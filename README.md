# DU-PDA-coded
Code for the Deep Unfolded Probability Association Detector (DU-PDA) implementation with polar encoding/decoding. This code may be used for reproducing the numerical results seen in:

Souza, P.H.C.d., Mendes, L.L. Low-complexity deep unfolded neural network receiver for MIMO systems based on the probability data association detector. J Wireless Com Network 2022, 69 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-022-02152-0

Attention! Both 'signal_processing_mimo_iid_coded.py' and 'signal_processing_mimo_iid_v2.py' are needed by the main script 'DU_PDA_coded.py'.
