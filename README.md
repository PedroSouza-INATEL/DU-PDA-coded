# DU-PDA-coded
Code for the Deep Unfolded Probability Association Detector (DU-PDA) implementation with polar encoding/decoding. This code may be used for reproducing the numerical results seen in:

'Pedro Henrique Carneiro Souza, Luciano Leonel Mendes. Low-complexity Deep Unfolded Neural Network Receiver for MIMO Systems Based on the Probability Data Association Detector, 24 March 2022, PREPRINT (Version 1) available at Research [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1439479/v1]'

Attention! Both signal_processing_mimo_iid_coded.py and signal_processing_mimo_iid_v2.py are needed by the main script DU_PDA_coded.py.
